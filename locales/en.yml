home.about: >
  <p>I'm Giada and I'm a photographer specializing in wedding reportage.</p>
  <p>I was born in Turin, a city of art and magic. And it is in the streets of
  this city that my passion for photography was born. I have always been
  sentimental, in love with love and everything that this feeling can arouse in
  people.</p> <p>Accomplicing glances, fleeting kisses and imperceptible details
  have always been my greatest source of inspiration. For this reason, in a
  succession of events that have crossed my path, I have chosen to devote myself
  to wedding photography and specifically to reportage.</p> <p>My ability to
  capture people's spontaneity could only be combined with the most spontaneous
  thing that exists: love.<br/> And this is how I will tell the day of your
  wedding: with discretion and a wealth of details.</p> <p>I will be moved and
  smile with you.</p> <p>Mine is a serious and profound study that for years has
  allowed me to grow and expand my visual baggage not only directly on the field
  of my weddings but also by carefully watching weddings of gurus and mentors of
  reportage photography from all over the world.</p> <p>I would describe my work
  as a search for perfection in imperfection.<br/> The detailed story of the
  most beautiful day for a couple, made with a wealth of details but also with
  discretion.<br/> The best compliment that the spouses give me after seeing the
  photos is that it seems to them to relive the wedding day through my shots
  with details that not even they remembered.</p> <p>My success, and the reason
  why I invite you to choose me, is just that: I will tell your story, your
  special day, your love with a fresh, young, spontaneous and as natural
  approach as possible. For me, <em>you</em> exist, with your strengths and
  weaknesses that make you unique and that I'm sure are the ones that allowed
  your other half to fall in love with you. I am interested in your looks, the
  embarrassed smiles when you look at each other after saying that "yes" at the
  altar, the kisses and the hands that cross as you walk side by side. In a
  word, I'm interested in you, and my camera and I will do everything in our
  power to give you the perfect images to describe who you are.</p> <p>â‹¯</p>

  Photographing is a way of life. But life is important, not photography. It is
  important to tell. If you start from photography you get nowhere else than
  photography.
